# Overview

This cheatsheet covers the minimal key aspects on how to use "the Numpy Stack". This stack is foundational to any
machine learning and data science work done in Python.

The cheat sheet covers:
1. Numpy: provides the basic `numpy array` abstraction to work with multi-dimensional arrays in Python. Everything else 
is built upon this.
2. Matplotlib: A library for data visualization.
3. Pandas: a library for reading, writing and manipulating data.
4. SciPy: statistical computations (among many other things).

The work is based on a mixture of different resources. Notably:

# Table of Content

This is a work in progress and finishing all topics I want to cover will take a while. However, 
this TOC points to the sections that I have finalized.
